# TaskApp

“Taskit” is an app that allows people to register any type of task, such as walking a
dog, hiring a babysitter even just for one day, buying products, installing Windows,
painting walls, and so on. In addition, any user can also perform the given task. 

This means that you do not have to have a professional education to earn a living. Bringing products or walking a dog does not
necessarily require a lot of education, it only takes desire and diligence. 

The application is easy to use:
- Each user can register as well as perform the tasks. 
- Since the application administration itself (at least at the initial stage) can not be responsible for the good
faith of the users during the execution of the task, after each case the customer can
evaluate the tasker, which includes a 5-star system and a comment. Therefore
everyone will be able to see Tasker’s reviews before selecting the preferred
candidate. The same goes for the customer, to ensure that the payment is finally
made and it is not a simple joke offer, the customers will be evaluated by the same
system and therefore the customer with bad reviews will not be offered their
services. 
- Any person can offer to perform this task, and the customer will
choose the preferred candidate for the given case.
